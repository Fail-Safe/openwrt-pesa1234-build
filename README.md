# openwrt-pesa1234-build

This is a definition of a viable build container for building [@pesa1234's](https://github.com/pesa1234) OpenWrt image.

## About

This project and container does not replace the need to have knowledge about the [OpenWrt Build System](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/use-buildsystem).

The intent of this project is to provide a minimal basis for those wanting to get into building [@pesa1234's](https://github.com/pesa1234) image for the incredible [GL.iNet GL-MT6000 device](https://openwrt.org/toh/gl.inet/gl-mt6000).

Knowledge of how to work with the build system, including Menuconfig, is up to the user of this repo.

## Requirements

* One or more [GL.iNet GL-MT6000 Devices](https://openwrt.org/toh/gl.inet/gl-mt6000)
* Reading Skills (Did you read through the [OpenWrt Build System](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/use-buildsystem) usage yet? ðŸ˜‰)
* Follow [@pesa1234's](https://github.com/pesa1234) [MT6000 Build Thread](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/mt6000-custom-build-with-luci-and-some-optimization-kernel-6-6-x/185241)
* Patience
* Patience
* Patience (Yes, I wrote this three times. I'm serious about this.)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* Basic shell/bash Experience
* Willingness to hit a bug, live through it, be a decent human, and respectfully bring it forward. ðŸ˜Ž

## Usage

### Clone this Repo

Clone this project to your local system:

Https:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Fail-Safe/openwrt-pesa1234-build.git && cd openwrt-pesa1234-build
```

SSH:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Fail-Safe/openwrt-pesa1234-build.git && cd openwrt-pesa1234-build
```

### Container Volume

Because a Docker container's default storage is ephemeral, you will not want to lose your build environment everytime you exit the container (whether intentionally or due to a crash/reboot/etc.).

We get around this by creating a [Docker Volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to hold the non-ephemeral build system. We then mount this persistent volume each time we run the build container.

I have included a script to create a Docker volume for this purpose. If you are an advanced Docker user, feel free to skip this step and configure an alternate mount option yourself.

#### Create Container Volume

Run the following one time:

```bash
$ ./scripts/1_Create_Container_Volume.sh
```

You should see this:

```bash

>> Creating docker volume:
pesa1234-build

>> Created docker volume pesa1234-build for your build system.
```

If you see the following output, you have already created this volume and do not need to recreate it regularly:

```bash
bash-5.2$ ./scripts/1_Create_Container_Volume.sh

>> ** Uh oh! The docker volume pesa1234-build already exists. You likely do not want to be running this again! **
```

### Container Image

To create or update the build container image, run the following:

```bash
$ ./scripts/2_Create_or_Update_Container_Image.sh
```

âš  ***This will take some time to run!***

On my MacBook Pro M1, this container image takes upwards of 10 minutes to build. Grab a cola, coffee, or a water and relax. Let it run its course.

Patience is something you will need to learn if you're going to be building your own OpenWrt images. ðŸ˜‰

If all goes well, you will end up with some output that looks like this:

```

### Run the Build Image

Once you have allowed the Container Image to build to completion, you are now ready to launch (read: run) the container.

You can do so by running:

```bash
$ ./scripts/3_Run_Build_Container.sh
```

âœ… ***This script can be run anytime you want to launch your build environment.***

If all went well, you should drop into the container like so:

```bash
bash-5.2$ ./scripts/3_Run_Build_Container.sh

```

## Setup [Pesa1234's](https://github.com/pesa1234) Repo

Last, but far from least, there is a script you will need to **run at least one time** that I have placed into your container's `/tmp` directory.

The script will:
- Get the defined branch from Pesa123's repo
- Get the required config for the specific version (or the default config)
- Ensure your build environment is set up correctly
- Copy any extra files or a `diffconfig` from your local `./extra/` folder into the `~/openwrt/` build environment in the container

If you need to make changes to the downloaded versions, you can edit the file in `docker/assets/setup_pesa1234_repo.sh` and restart the container.

You will execute the script as follows **from within the container**:

```bash
$ /tmp/setup_pesa1234_repo.sh
```

You should see output that looks like this:

```bash

## Check Docker Virtual Disk Limit

A baseline, vanilla build requires around 15GB of space.

Baseline Config:
```bash
CONFIG_TARGET_mediatek=y
CONFIG_TARGET_mediatek_filogic=y
CONFIG_TARGET_mediatek_filogic_DEVICE_glinet_gl-mt6000=y
```

Docker Desktop by default limits disk space for Docker Volumes (called 'Virtual disk limit' in the GUI) to something lesser than that size. Double-check that you are allowing Docker Volume space ('Virtual disk limit') to use upwards of 24GB is a critical step.

![Docker Virtual Disk Limit](/.github/readme/virtual_disk_limit_guide.png)

Depending on the additional libraries, packages, firmware, etc you may select to include in your build, even 24GB of allocated space may not be enough. My rule of thumb is that anytime you hit an unexpected build error, be in the habit of running a quick `df -h` to ensure your Docker volume space is not exhausted.

Clearing space on a Docker Volume is outside the scope of this README/project, but there are plenty of guides available on the net to help you out. Take time to learn--it's a blast! ðŸ’¯

## Next Steps

Did you read through the [OpenWrt Build System](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/use-buildsystem) usage yet? ðŸ˜‰

Seriously.

From here the process to build will follow standard process in the OpenWrt build system.

e.g. For those of you who just aren't going to read the docs...

```bash
$ git fetch
$ git pull
$ ./scripts/feeds update -a
$ ./scripts/feeds install -a
$ make menuconfig
$ make defconfig
$ make -j$((1+`nproc`)) clean download world V=s 2>&1 | tee build.log | grep -i -E "^make.*(error|[12345]...Entering dir)"
```

The first build is going to take a while, seriously. In a newly cloned OpenWrt repo, the toolchain for your target platform must be built before the general build (read: packages) for your image. Once the toolchain is built, subsequent builds will be faster as the toolchain is not cleaned between each build.

## Copy the build artifacts from the container

After the OpenWrt build has succeeded, it is stored inside the container. To upload it to your router, you need to copy it to your local drive.

Open a **second** terminal in the cloned repo (where this README is stored), **without exiting the docker container** and run the following command:

```bash
docker cp pesa1234-builder:/home/user/openwrt/bin .
```

## Feedback

I am providing this as a free resource written in my own time, just as [Pesa1234](https://github.com/pesa1234) pours hours of life into the source repo. That said, I welcome any feedback and will get to any bug fixes or improvements as time allows.

Thanks and enjoy!
